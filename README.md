# Guess_the_number
#Identify the problem: 
#What is the problem (tener claro el objetivo)? user must insert a number that matched the random number generated by the computer (the times necessary to guess the number)
#What information gives us? The numbers inserted by the user
#What is the result expected? The matching between the number inserted by the user and the computer
#-variable_que_guarde_el_número_random —> int
#-variable_que_guarde_número_ingresado_por_usuario —>int (input data)
#- print that show the variable_que_guarde_número_ingresado_por_usuario_matches—> int (output data)
#What are the variables required for the intermediate process?
#-x=0
#Which conditions and restrictions are required for the solution?
#-only inter numbers can be entered by the user (restriction)
#What actions must be the program? (methods and formulas)
#-give clues to the user (greater, less, or equal than)
#-user<computer     compare the value
#Make a design of the algorithm (by using a flux diagram or pseudocode)
#-request the entry of the number (save the number in a variable) 
#-show if the number matches with the computer
#-If there is no coincidence repeat the above steps
